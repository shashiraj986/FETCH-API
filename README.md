# API Fetch Example

This simple project demonstrates how to fetch and display data from a public API using the JavaScript Fetch API.

## Features

- Retrieves user information from [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users).
- Displays user name, email, and address in styled cards.
- Handles network errors gracefully and shows a message if fetching fails.
- Includes a reload button to refresh the data on demand.

## Files

- `index.html` - Basic HTML structure with a container for users and a reload button.
- `styles.css` - Basic styling for the page and user cards.
- `script.js` - Fetch logic, DOM manipulation, and error handling.

## Usage

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser (Chrome recommended).
3. The page will automatically load and display users.
4. Click the **Reload Data** button to fetch the data again.
5. To test error handling, disable your internet connection and reload.

## Development

No build tools or dependencies are required. This is a plain HTML/JS project.
